/*
 * This package contains various complex widgets. Most of them are 
 * wrappers around various jQuery UI components, but not all of them are.
 * Regardless, the root component is marked with the class --intercept, which
 * indicates that the viewcore.js file should manage them. If you need to
 * modify their behavior, you should be aware of how the widget works before
 * attempting to modify it.
