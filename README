VH is a library that simplifies and abstracts the View and Controller portions
of the MVC design paradigm. The main feature of VH is its View classes, that
wrap and abstract HTML to the point that you don't need to write HTML ever.

This paradigm is much different than the standard template system that most
websites use, but is nonetheless much more flexible and powerful. If you 
properly use the system, your code will be efficient, testable, maintainable,
and valid, which is not something that can easily be said for code written
using a templating system. Using PHP's powerful inheritance mechanisms, View
classes can be easily extended, changing and customizing the many built in
classes to suit your needs. Most rote tasks are abstracted up to the extent
that very little code needs to be written to specify your desired results,
since the concept of Convention Over Configuration is used, but it makes sure
that Customizability is not sacrificed. Additionally, things are kept in
programmatic terms until the very last second, which means that intentions
can be automatically re-used as necessary, for instance, when validating
parameters returned by a ajax-submitted form, you must only specify the 
validation parameters once, and the framework takes care of validating them both
server side and client side. jQuery and jQuery UI are baked in too, with quick,
easy ways built in to manipulate the client side behavior directly in PHP,
without having to actually write javascript, unless you are doing something very
custom.

VH is released under the unrestrictive MIT license, so you are free to use this
project in Open Source projects, as well as closed source commercial projects,
without having to worry.
